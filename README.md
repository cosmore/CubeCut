# cubeCut

cubeCut is a flask server, presenting a html5 website on any device with a browser
which displays buttons and trigger keyboard shortcuts on your server. Nothing more,
nothing less.

It gives DAW users a possibility to run commands from any device without midi or portabiliy 
restrictions.
